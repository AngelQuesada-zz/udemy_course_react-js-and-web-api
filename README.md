Course Description:

 In this course we will learn how to build a Web application from scratch. We will use React JS for front end, Microsoft SQL server for data base and ASP.NET Web API for creating APIs. This is not a complete theoretical guide on React JS but a practical based approach where we will learn to build a Web App using React JS by using some of the most commonly used controls. This course will be regularly updated. Make sure to check out the additional resources section of this course for theoretical/advanced concepts.
